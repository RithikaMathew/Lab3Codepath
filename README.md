# Unit 3 Lab: ‚òï On My Grind*

Submitted by:Rithika Mathew

Have you ever wanted to work at Starbucks? You're about to be one step closer. In this app inspired by Wordle, memorize coffee drink recipes and quiz yourself on a random real (and possibly discontinued üòâ) Starbucks drink's temperature, flavor, milk type, and blendedness. The app will let you know if you're a natural at barista-ing.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total
